# Bamazon
An Amazon-like CLI storefront that takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory.

To use this application, you will need to npm install MySQL and Inquirer. Be sure to run the following lines in node.js:
* `<npm init>`
* `<npm i mysql>`
* `<npm i inquirer>`

Additionally, you can use a table formatting package like console.table to improve the readability of your table.
